#### When first founded, Carraglen's mission was to provide highly professional and reliable services within the construction industry. Our aim is to deliver high quality, value for money construction projects to our valued clients.

Carraglen is made up of a dedicated, dynamic and highly experienced management team that works alongside a select few highly skilled craftsmen. By working in this way we're able to provide bespoke construction project services to the highest standards. Everyone on the Carraglen team is truly passionate about their role, which is why every project we complete; no matter if it's a penthouse apartment refurbishment or commercial building fit out, it’s of exceptional quality.

By utilising the latest in cutting edge design and build solutions, we can maintain an exceptional standard of excellence across all aspects of construction project. For the past 15 years we have been successfully delivering finished projects to a variety of high-end clients in both the public and private sector.

## What we believe

From transparent quotes and costing’s, to regular communications with project updates, everything we do is based on our focus on clients. From project inception right through to project closure, we have as much passion for the success of a project as our client does, and it is this which ensures that we maintain high quality at every turn.

> Clients are always our number one priority.

We've built a reputation for being reliable, honest and straight talking, and we're proud to be a construction partner that our clients wholeheartedly trust. With the very best industry talent on our team, cutting edge design and construction solutions up our sleeves, and a true passion for client satisfaction, we're a partner you can truly count on.

## The cornerstones to success

The approach we take to each of our projects is based on three all-important cornerstones: quality, time and cost. From sourcing project materials to streamlining the development process, no small detail is overlooked and it is this, which has allowed us to carve out a strong reputation within the construction industry.

Our past clients tell us that we're honest, flexible and straight talking. These important attributes allow us to really get to the heart of our clients needs and to deliver a project, which fulfils and exceeds all their expectations.
