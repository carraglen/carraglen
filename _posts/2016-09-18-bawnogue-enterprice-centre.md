#### Bawnogue Village Core was a project that was driven by both the local community and South Dublin County Council. 

The development consisted of an office space, a large Crèche and 35 enterprise units that had the flexibility of being connected together to form larger units. The units were constructed with structural steel frames, load bearing masonry walls and precast concrete floors.
