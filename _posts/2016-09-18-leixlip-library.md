#### This community library was designed and constructed on a corner site in Leixlip, along a pedestrian route from the railway station to the shopping centre and is arranged in a fan shape around the entrance area and librarianâ€™s desk.

A mixture of reinforced insitu concrete columns and steel portal structure to give a large open plan area. The creative space planning and contemporary design made it an innovative and inspiring space.
